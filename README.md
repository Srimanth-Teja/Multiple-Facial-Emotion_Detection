# Multiple-Facial-Emotion_Detection
The title of our mini project is multiple facial emotion detection.
From the domain of machine learning and image processing.
The main objective of our project is, we will be detecting the seven different types of emotions, those are happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, neutral and disgust.
We have implemented this project in two different ways,
The first method is, we have created a graphical user interface(GUI), then we will be taking a random image from the internet and inserting it into the GUI, then it shows up as any one of the emotions.
The second method is, live detection through a webcam, whoever is in front of the webcam, it detects the emotion of them, whether there is a single person or multiple people.
software technologies used in this project are, Any operating system, Internet connection for sure, Visual studio editor, Python programming : version 3.5 and above. Google colab or jupyter notebook, Machine learning libraries and files to perform the task : primarily algorithms like random forest and Convolutional neural networks.
Some of the packages used are : openCV, Keras and tensorflow.
The implementation part includes,
a. Collecting the dataset from kaggle.com.
b. It consists of two directories, train directory and validation directory.
c. In each of those two directories, we have again seven different directories of emotions. Named happy,sad,fear,anger,surprise,neutral and disgust. In each folder, it consists of some collection of images.
d. Overall, the dataset consists of 35,900 images.
Here, while training the model, each epoch has taken a minimum time of 222 seconds and maximum time of 240 seconds.
This implies an average of 4 minutes for each epoch. For a total of 139 epochs, the total minutes taken are 556 minutes which is equivalent to 9 hours 26 minutes.
The final accuracy score on validation comes out to be 96% which is better than most existing state-of-the-art results.
Theadvantagesofmultiplefacialemotion detection are :
a. It is useful and important for security and health care purposes.
b. It is crucial for easy and simple detection of human feelings at specific moments without actually asking them.
c. Facial expressions can display personal emotions and indicate an individual intentions within a social situation.
d. The human face is extremely expressive, able to convey countless emotions without saying a word.
e. Emotion detection can be used to analyze emotions expressed in social media posts, comments, or messages. This can be valuable for sentiment analysis and understanding public opinions and emotions on various topics.
f. In virtual reality and gaming, emotion detection can create more immersive and realistic experiences. Game characters or virtual avatars can respond to the player's emotional cues, making the interactions more dynamic and engaging.
g. As this project is just in the beginning step itself, if this is implemented more and more advanced, then it can reach out to the various other technologies as well and collide with the most prominent domains.
